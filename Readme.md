#Hello World

hello world file

Now let's see what happens if I change this remote file before changing something on my computer.

Change #6: Changing this file remotely, and trying to "pull" project back onto my computer without the extra options. Huh. "git pull" did not actually download change #6 onto my computer.

Change #8:Now I have to repeat all this from scratch in a new repo. And I also have a feeling I don't understand half of what's going on here. But at least I can sort of push and pull files to/from github. That is a major vicotry.
