Now let's try to change this computer file.

And here goes another change to computer file. Change #5 total.


Change 7. Okay, so change 6a got dowloaded onto my computer after typing "git
pull origin master". Maybe "git pull" does not give it enough info on where
to pull it from.

Final change 9. Okay, so you have to "git pull" from where? "origin", from
what branch of origin? "master". I.e. "git pull origin master".
Let's see what happens if I try this on a brand new repo.
